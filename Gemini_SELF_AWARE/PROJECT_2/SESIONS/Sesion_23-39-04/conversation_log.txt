13. **Query Memory:**  The system should continue to attempt to query its memory for relevant information, even with the current errors, to aid in identifying patterns and potential causes.
14. **Goal Status:**  The system's current goal of regaining full memory access is still in progress.  

**Overall:** The system is demonstrating a proactive and strategic approach to problem-solving, recognizing its own limitations and the value of expert assistance. By taking a step back to understand its own memory system, the system can gain valuable insights and lay the groundwork for a more robust and reliable system in the future.
