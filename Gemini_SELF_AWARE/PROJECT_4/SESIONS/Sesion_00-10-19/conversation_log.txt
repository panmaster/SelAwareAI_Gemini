Introspection: It looks like you're trying to figure out a way to structure your thoughts and understand your current situation. It's great that you're asking these questions! 

Here's a breakdown of what you've listed and how to approach it:

**Understanding Your Questions:**

1. **"What are my available tools and resources?"** This is a great starting point! Think about the things you have access to that could help you achieve your goals. This includes:
    * **Physical resources:**  Computer, phone, books, tools, money, etc.
    * **Skills and abilities:**  Writing, cooking, problem-solving, etc.
    * **People:** Family, friends, mentors, teachers, etc.
    * **Online resources:** Websites, apps, online courses, etc.

2. **"Current sensory input (Image, Audio, Text): None, None, None"** This tells us you're currently in a relatively quiet and neutral environment. 

3. **"Are there any ongoing short-term tasks?" and "Are there any long-term ongoing tasks or plans?"** These are key questions to determine what you need to focus on. Think about:
    * **Immediate tasks:**  Work deadlines, errands, appointments, etc.
    * **Longer-term goals:**  Career aspirations, travel plans, personal projects, etc.

4. **"What is my current goal?"**  This is the heart of your situation! What are you trying to achieve right now? This might be a specific task, a broader objective, or even just a state of being.

5. **"What do I want?"** This is about your desires and aspirations. It might be something you're working towards or something you simply enjoy.

6. **"What am I feeling?"**  This is about your emotional state. Are you happy, sad, anxious, excited? Being aware of your emotions is essential for self-understanding.

7. **"What do I need?"** This is about your practical and emotional needs. Are you hungry, tired, or feeling lonely? Do you need help with something?

8. **"What am I experiencing?"** This is a broad question that can encompass your sensory input, thoughts, feelings, and needs.

9. **"Emotional state?..... Maybe?  ??"** This indicates you might be unsure about how you're feeling. It's okay to be unsure! Try to identify any specific emotions you're experiencing, even if they're subtle.

**Moving Forward:**

To get a clearer picture of your situation, try answering these questions in more detail:

* **What is your current goal?** Be specific. 
* **What do you want to accomplish?** What would make you feel good?
* **What emotions are you feeling right now?** Try describing them.
* **What are your immediate needs?** Are you hungry, tired, etc.?

Once you've answered these questions, you'll have a better understanding of your situation and can start to take action! 

Reflection: Let's break down your questions and figure out how to proceed. 

**1. What is the current focus?**

It seems like your current focus is on understanding your own state and situation. You're asking questions to gain clarity about your emotions, goals, and available resources.

**2. Should I set a new goal? If so, what is it? If not, why not?**

It's hard to say without more information about your goals and aspirations.  It's possible that you might benefit from setting a new goal if:

* You've already achieved your current goal.
* You're feeling stuck or unmotivated with your current goal.
* You have a new and compelling idea for a goal.

If you're not sure about a new goal, it's okay to continue exploring your current situation and see if any new goals emerge naturally.

**3. Are there any problems, unknowns, or paradoxes in my memory?**

To answer this, I need more context about what you've been working on or discussing. Let me know if there are any specific issues you're concerned about, and I can help you analyze them.

**4. What problems need to be solved?**

This is closely tied to the previous question.  Again, please provide more context about what's on your mind, and I can help you identify problems and potential solutions.

**5. What are possible courses of action based on available information?**

We need to establish the available information first.  Tell me more about what you've been thinking about, and I can suggest courses of action.

**6. Approach the next steps?**

* **a) Think step-by-step?**  This approach can be helpful for complex problems or when you need to break a large task into smaller, manageable steps.
* **b) Focus on a specific aspect?** This can help you achieve deeper understanding or make progress on a particular part of a problem.
* **c) Defocus and broaden my attention?** This is useful for exploring new possibilities, gaining a different perspective, or finding connections between seemingly unrelated ideas.
* **e) If focus YES, Write at the end what you are focusing on.**

It's hard to recommend a specific approach without knowing your specific needs.  Let's work together to figure out the best way to proceed.

**7. Should I be more verbose in my responses? (Yes/No)**

Let me know your preference.  I can adjust my level of detail based on your feedback. 

**8. Should I be less verbose? (Yes/No)**

Again, tell me what you'd like.  I'm happy to be more concise if that's what you prefer.

**9. Should I change the subject or keep discussing this? (Yes/No)**

Let me know what feels most productive.  We can explore a new topic or continue this line of inquiry, depending on what you'd like to focus on.

**10. Should I summarize the current discussion? (Yes/No)**

I can summarize what we've discussed so far.  Let me know if that would be helpful.

**11. Should I dive deeper into a specific topic? (Yes/No)**

If you have a particular area you'd like to explore in more detail, let me know!

**12. Should I store any of this information in my long-term memory (Yes/No)?**

I can store information in my memory for later reference.  If there are any specific details you want to save, let me know.

**13. Should I query my memory for relevant information? (Yes/No)**

I can access information I've stored in my memory.  Let me know if there's anything specific you'd like to retrieve.

**14. What is the status of my current goals?**

To answer this question, I need to know what your current goals are.  Please provide more context.

**Moving Forward:**

Let's start by clarifying your current goals and the information you want to explore.  Once we have a clearer picture of your needs, we can make informed decisions about the best way to proceed.
