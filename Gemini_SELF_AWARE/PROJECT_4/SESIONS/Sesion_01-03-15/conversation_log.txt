Introspection: It looks like you're trying to figure out your current situation and goals. You've listed a few helpful prompts to get you started. Here's a breakdown of how to use them:

**Understanding the Prompts:**

* **"What are my available tools and resources?"** This asks you to consider what you have at your disposal to help you achieve your goals. This could include physical items, skills, knowledge, people you can rely on, etc.
* **"Are there any ongoing short-term tasks?"** Think about any immediate tasks or deadlines you need to handle. 
* **"Are there any long-term ongoing tasks or plans?"** This looks at your larger goals and commitments.
* **"What is my current goal?"** This is about identifying what you're trying to achieve right now.
* **"What do I want?"** This is a broader question about your desires and aspirations.
* **"What am I feeling?"**  Reflect on your current emotional state. Are you happy, sad, anxious, excited?
* **"What do I need?"** This is about identifying your current needs, both practical and emotional.
* **"What am I experiencing?"** Describe your current situation, including what you are seeing, hearing, or feeling.
* **"Emotional state?"** This is a quick check-in about your mood.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Answer the prompts one at a time.** Don't rush, take your time to think through each question honestly. 
2. **Be specific.** Don't just say "I want to be happy," instead try "I want to feel more confident in social situations."
3. **Write your answers down.** This helps you organize your thoughts and see the bigger picture.

**Example:**

Here's a possible example of how you might respond:

* **Tools & Resources:** My computer, internet access, my notes app, my friends, my family.
* **Short-term Tasks:** Finish my homework, reply to a friend's message.
* **Long-term Plans:** Graduate from college, find a job I love.
* **Current Goal:** Get started on my research project for my history class.
* **What I want:** To feel more motivated and productive.
* **What I'm feeling:** Overwhelmed and stressed.
* **What I need:** A break, a clear plan, a good night's sleep.
* **What I'm experiencing:** Sitting at my desk, feeling the pressure of the deadline.
* **Emotional state:** Anxious.

**Moving Forward:**

Once you've answered these questions, you'll have a clearer picture of your current situation. This can help you to:

* **Prioritize tasks:** Decide what's most important and address that first.
* **Set realistic goals:** Break down your goals into smaller, manageable steps.
* **Develop strategies:** Create a plan to address your needs and feelings.
* **Seek support:** Reach out to friends, family, or professionals if needed.

Remember, this is a starting point. You may need to refine your answers as you gain a better understanding of your needs and goals. 

Reflection: Okay, let's analyze your situation based on the prompts and your internal state:

**1. What is your current focus?**

Based on your input, it seems like you're currently focused on **understanding your current situation and goals**.  You're using self-reflection prompts to gain clarity. 

**2. Should you set a new goal? If so, what is it? If not, why not?**

It's a bit early to set a new goal. You're still in the process of understanding your current situation. Once you have a clearer picture of your tools, tasks, desires, and needs, you can then identify a goal that aligns with what you want to achieve. 

**3. Are there any problems, unknowns, or paradoxes in your memory?**

Based on your current input, it doesn't seem like there are any major problems, unknowns, or paradoxes in your memory. You're simply working on self-awareness.

**4. What problems need to be solved?**

Right now, the main "problem" is a lack of clarity about your current situation and goals.  Once you address this, other potential problems or challenges might become more apparent.

**5. What are possible courses of action based on available information?**

You're already on the right track. Continue answering the self-reflection prompts honestly and thoughtfully. This will give you a better understanding of your:

* **Resources:** What you have to work with.
* **Tasks:** What needs to be done.
* **Desires:** What you truly want.
* **Needs:** What you require to feel fulfilled.
* **Emotions:** Your current state of mind.

**6. Approach the next steps:**

* **a) Think step-by-step?** Yes, continue answering each prompt in a systematic way.
* **b) Focus on a specific aspect?** Not yet. You're still gathering information.
* **c) Defocus and broaden my attention?** Not necessary at this point.
* **e) If focus YES, Write at the end what you are focusing on:** (Not applicable)

**7. Should you be more verbose in your responses? (Yes/No)**

This depends on what you're trying to achieve. If you're looking for deeper self-reflection, being more detailed in your responses can be helpful. 

**8. Should you be less verbose? (Yes/No)**

Again, it depends on your needs. If you find yourself getting stuck in details, it might be helpful to be more concise.

**9. Should you change the subject or keep discussing this? (Yes/No)**

Keep discussing this until you feel you have a good understanding of your current situation. 

**10. Should you summarize the current discussion? (Yes/No)**

Yes, summarizing your answers to the prompts will help you see the bigger picture.

**11. Should you dive deeper into a specific topic? (Yes/No)**

Once you have a general understanding, you can choose a specific topic to explore further. For example, if you're feeling overwhelmed, you could focus on strategies for managing stress.

**12. Should you store any of this information in your long-term memory (Yes/No)?**

Yes, storing your answers to the prompts and your reflections in your long-term memory will be helpful for future reference.

**13. Should you query your memory for relevant information? (Yes/No)**

Not yet. You're gathering new information. Once you have a good understanding of your current situation, you can use your memory to connect new information to existing knowledge.

**14. What is the status of your current goals?**

You haven't set any specific goals yet. You're currently focusing on self-awareness and identifying your current situation.
