Introspection: It seems like you're trying to access some sort of internal system or program that's tracking your goals, feelings, and tasks. 

Here's what I can help you with, based on what you've provided:

* **Understanding the Structure:** You seem to be using a format with headings like "Current sensory input" and "Emotional state". This is a good start!  It helps to organize your internal thoughts and needs.

* **Adding More Detail:**  To make this system truly useful, consider expanding on each section. For example:
    * **Current sensory input:** Instead of "None",  you could list anything you are currently experiencing, like "Hearing the sound of rain", "Feeling the warmth of the sun", or "Seeing a bright red apple".
    * **Short-term tasks:**  What are you planning to do in the next few minutes, hours, or day?  
    * **Long-term tasks or plans:**  What are your goals for the week, month, or year?
    * **What is my current goal?** This is the most important part! What are you trying to achieve right now? 
    * **What do I want?** This can be more general than a specific goal. What are your desires, ambitions, or hopes? 
    * **What am I feeling?** Describe your emotional state using words like happy, sad, anxious, excited, etc.
    * **What do I need?** Think about your physical and emotional needs. Do you need food, water, rest, or support?
    * **What am I experiencing?** This could include thoughts, feelings, physical sensations, or any other internal experiences.
    * **Emotional state?** Instead of "Maybe?  ??", provide a specific description of your emotional state. 

* **Using the System Regularly:**  The more you use this system, the better you will understand yourself and your goals.  Make it a habit to check in with yourself regularly and update this information. 

**Remember:**  This is a personal tool for self-reflection. There is no right or wrong way to use it.  The most important thing is that it helps you understand yourself better.
